screen_intro,prescreen,,yesno,"Hello [Patient's Name],
My name is [Your Name], and I am the [Study Coordinator] at the University of Florida. I am contacting you to see if you are interested in participating in a research study focused on understanding pain and recovery after knee and hip replacement surgery. During a past clinic visit,  you signed a consent form telling us you were interested in being  contacted for future research that you may qualify for.

Are you interested in hearing more about this research study?

screen_interest,prescreen,,yesno,"Do you have about 10-15 minutes now to talk about the study or should we schedule a more convenient time? [If now is fine, continue. If not, schedule a time to call them back.]
The purpose of this study is to identify factors that predict pain and function after undergoing knee or hip replacement. If you choose to participate, you will be one of 300 people to take part in this study. Your participation will require 5 visits over a period of nine months, with two of these visits occurring virtually (you will not be required to come in to our clinic). These sessions will last approximately 20 minutes to 2.5 hours. 
If eligible, a baseline research appointment will be scheduled. This appointment will take place within 2-4 weeks of your surgery. After the initial appointment, you will be asked to attend four visits over the course of 9 months after your surgery. 
During these visits, you will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires, a brief physical activity test, an exam assessing your perception of pressure and heat sensation, and heart rate monitoring.  You will also be asked to collect saliva at three of your visits and to wear a Garmin watch for collection of sleep and physical activity. In recognition of your time, you will be paid a maximum of $400 for completing the study. 

Does this study sound of interest to you?
